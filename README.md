### Break down of what tests test

Tests were designed to show OOP concepts

```
It should test that the type of the object corresponds with the type object

It should test inheritance by instantiating default attributes for objects not completely defined

It should show Polymorphism by having a subclass derive behaviors from the superclass

It should test that the car drives when 'thy pedal is put to thy metal'

```
